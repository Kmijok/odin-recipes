        <h1>Berry Smoothie</h1>
        <h3>The perfect mix of refreshing flavours and healthy vitamins while being a simple and easy cool drink</h3>
        <h5>What you'll need</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Some bananas</li>
            <li>Berries of your choice</li>
            <li>Milk, Fruit Juice or Yoghurt</li>
            <li>a Mixer</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Here's how you do it</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Take out your mixer of choice</li>
            <li>Prepare your berries. Frozen berries do not need to be heated</li>
            <li>Add berries and fruits into mixer according to taste. Place larger chunks (e.g. bananas) closest to the blade</li>
            <li>Add a little bit of liquid to help the blades. After mixing a bit, add more and mix until you reach a desired consistency</li>
            <li>Pour into a glass and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also add other fruits such as mango or pineapple. For a health-boost, you can toss in some seeds or oats. No sugar needed, serve immediately.</p>
